    "restriction": "Characters who haven't become literate yet or that cannot be heard can't speak using specific spoken languages. Other methods to speak, such as by signs or gestures can bypass those but with an inherent penalty if done to characters that use or hear speech by normal means, which needs specialized hardcoded engine functionality or file parsing implementation through custom/generated user content. Those should always take all dynamic/user created data/implementations into consideration.",
    "untrained": "Without training users cannot fully read/write in a new language but they may attempt a partial, though likely to be faulty/misinterpreted, usage."

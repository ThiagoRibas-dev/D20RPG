    "check": "A check may be made to inspect or analyze structures or fortifications to detect hidden entrances or structural weaknesses as well as to guide/manage construction for various complex buildings and devices, including ships. You can build large ships but smaller ones must rely on different crafts, such as with boatbuilding",

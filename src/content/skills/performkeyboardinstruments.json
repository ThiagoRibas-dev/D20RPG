    "try_again": "Yes, but after multiple retries and failures audiences may be less inclined to watch/listen to their performance unless improved or unless the context or format is drastically changed. Specifics apply depending on location, and type of show being used. If using magic as an aid check those spells descriptions or powers to avoid specific incompatibilities.

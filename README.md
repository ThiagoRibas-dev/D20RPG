# 2D Turn-Based RPG (D&D 3.5e Inspired)

This project is a 2D, turn-based, tile-based role-playing game (RPG) inspired by the mechanics of Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition (D&D 3.5e) and classic RPGs like Pool of Radiance and Knights of the Chalice. It features a "WeGo" turn-based system where the world progresses after the player takes actions.

**Key Features:**

*   **D20 Game Mechanics:** The game uses a simplified version of the D&D 3.5e ruleset, under the Open Game License (OGL) 1.0a.
*   **User-Generated Content:** A major focus is on allowing users to create and modify game content easily. Users can add their own races, classes, items, spells, maps, quests, and campaigns using simple JSON files.
*   **Campaign-Based Structure:** The game supports multiple campaigns, each with its own self-contained set of maps, characters, organizations, and quests.
*   **Standalone Executable:** The game is built using TypeScript and packaged into a standalone executable using `pkg`, allowing users to run it with a simple double-click without needing Node.js or other dependencies.
